# Dependencies

The excellent m68k emulator on which this is software is built was
taken from:

+ [https://github.com/tonyheadford/m68k](https://github.com/tonyheadford/m68k)

and it is licensed "under the Open Source BSD License."

For now, to build this software, you need to have that jar in your path.

Once you've got that, just do `sbt run` and you should be in business.

If you want to use an existing ROM, a good place to start is Dilwyn Jones'
fantastic [pages](http://www.dilwyn.me.uk), e.g his [list of downloadable
ROMs](http://www.dilwyn.me.uk/qlrom/index.html).

# License

Please feel free to use this code for whatever you like.

# Status

At the moment this doesn't really do any at all, and is very much a
work in progress.
