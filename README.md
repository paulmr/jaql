# Dependencies

The excellent m68k emulator on which this is software is built was
taken from:

+ [https://github.com/tonyheadford/m68k](https://github.com/tonyheadford/m68k)

and it is licensed "under the Open Source BSD License."

For now, to build this software, you need to have that jar in your path.

Once you've got that, just do `sbt run` and you should be in business.
